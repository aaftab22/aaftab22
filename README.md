## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Aaftab

I'm a passionate Mobile & Web Developer based in Toronto, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ â€” with a strong focus on building smooth, efficient, and user-friendly apps.

ðŸ’» I specialize in:
- Native Android Development (Kotlin + Java)
- Cross-platform apps with React Native
- MERN Stack for full-stack web projects

ðŸš€ I enjoy turning ideas into real apps â€” whether itâ€™s for fun, freelancing, or solving real-world problems.

ðŸ“± I've published several apps on the Play Store, and I'm always refining my skills by exploring modern tools like AWS, Firebase, and scalable backend technologies.
